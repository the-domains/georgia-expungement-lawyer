# Why Getting Your Georgia Criminal History Restricted Matters?

Expungement, in the traditional sense, meant that your criminal records were destroyed. In the olden days, when everything was still on paper, the arresting agency would literally destroy the record, or "expunge" it. Nothing existed anymore. However, as we all know, in the modern world, nothing is ever gone. Once the first piece of information is entered into the computer, it is copied, replicated, backed up, shared, and so on and so forth. In fact, this notion of "expungement" no longer actually exists within the framework of Georgia Law. Now, the thing we use to refer to as "expungement" is now referred to as "Record Restriction".

So what do we mean by this vague and nebulous thing known as "Record Restriction"? Well, essentially, it means your official criminal history is always there, but who can see it what they can see is no longer simple or easy.

Why does this matter to you? Well, to be completely candid, it probably affects how much money you make or even if you can get a job. Now adays, a business can be liable for what an employee does if they knew or should have know that the employee had personal characteristic "whatever". Whatever, can mean you drink, or use drugs, or have certain sexual predisposition, or anything. Employers can and do get sued because they hired a "bad" person when they shouldn't have. I know because I've sued employers for doing this.

So, what do employers do? They run criminal background checks. They run them from a variety of different sources, but they check. Almost any employer that operates with the public or has more than a handful of employees is going to check your background. And, if you have a background that presents a risk, the employer is likely to just pass and go for someone that isn't going to expose them to liability for a lawsuit.

Well, that brings us to you. And what you can do about your background. First and foremost, you can examine whether or not anything can be done. The Record Restriction laws are so complex, and depend on so many things, that it's hard to decide and determine what if anything you can restrict unless you spend hours studying the law. Or, you can pay **$49.99 (ok, let's just call it $50),** and we'll do that for you.
