**Call 678-383-1690 to Start Clearing Your Record!!**
![Expungment Record Restriction](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0d4629ab1a9baaf73647ed6d38142d2655c0751e.jpg)

A recent Georgia Supreme Court case, [S15A1722\. MOSLEY v. LOWE.][0], held that the new record restriction law applies retroactively.  The key, according to the Court, is "to expand the right of individuals to restrict access to their criminal history record information."

You were arrested for a crime but were never convicted, nor did you ever enter a guilty plea in court. Now you can't find a job, or get into college, or get an apartment because the arrest is still on your criminal history. Call an experienced Georgia Expungement attorney at 678-383-1690 to find out if you are eligible to have the record of this arrest restricted.
