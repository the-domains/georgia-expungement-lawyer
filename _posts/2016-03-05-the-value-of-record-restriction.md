# The Value of Record Restriction
![Record Restriction helps you get a JOB!](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/618ce681f59a0c93a674e4656eb80000c5ca11c7.jpg)

First, oftentimes when you pursue a job, your employer will require a background check. Normally, you fill out a consent form, and the employer then goes to a law enforcement agency and requests a criminal history background check. This background check is done with the primary purpose of seeing if you have ever committed or have been accused of committing any crime. 

Normally, employers will not tell you why they never called you back. However, the law actually requires that the employer inform you of the reason they did not hire you if that reason was because of your criminal history. No one is checking to make sure the employers are actually doing this. 
A record restriction process cleans up your criminal history and removes any arrests or convictions that are invalid and eligible for removal. 

The first step in the process is an assessment. For $50, we will obtain a copy of your criminal history, discuss what events on your record are availbe for restriction, and then provide you with an exact quote on what it will cost to have these items removed from your record.
